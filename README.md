# Full Stack Web Development with Python, Django & React

## Assignment 01 | Batch 01 | 2024 | HTML, CSS & JS

### Overview

In this assignment, your task is to create a website following the design of the `pdf` file and make it interactive. Use the knowledge you've gained throughout the modules. All the resources and the design is given. Simply implement the design and make it interactive.

### Tasks

1. Design an HTML page with the contents as mentioned in the design in the `PDF` document. Name your html file `index.html`.
2. Add an external CSS file to the `index.html` and design the website as close as possible to the design in the external CSS file. Name your CSS file `style.css`. Make sure the left bar stays at full screen, fixed, and should not be scrolled on scroll. The text `Thank you for choosing 1 room` shouldn't be shown by default.
3. Create a JavaScript file named `script.js` and connect it to the HTML file.
4. Use JavaScript in the `Packages` section of the website to make the plus and minus buttons interactive. When the plus(+)/minus(-) button is clicked, the amount in the text `1 room`, and the amount `$199` should be changed accordingly. Like if someone clicks the plus(+) button one time, the text should be `2 room` and the amount should be `$298`.
5. In the `Packages` section, when the `Sign Up` button is clicked, show the text `Thank you for choosing 1 room`. Use the number of rooms chosen before this step. This text should be shown only after clicking the `Sign Up` button.
6. Form in the `Contact` section must not get submitted when any one of the fields is empty.
